# Strava Fitness Tracker

Strava is a popular social fitness app that allows users to track and share their physical activities, such as running, hiking and cycling. Due to its popularity, most fitness tracker device manufacturers (e.g. Garmin, Fitbit, Apple) have integrations to automatically transmit fitness activities to the platform. This is of interest because Strava has a REST API for accessing data whereas individual manufacturers (Garmin :() do not.

Strava is available for free, but some analytics are only easily accessible with a paid membership. This project aims to do the following:
- archive my personal strava data so I will always have access to it
- allow me to perform analytics on that archived data without worrying about API rate limits or metrics being taken away from the free plan
- have some fun with and learn more about processing geospatial + time series data
